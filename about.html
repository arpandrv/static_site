                    <h2>About This Project</h2>
                    <p>This website was developed as part of the <a href="#">HIT237 Building Interactive Software</a> course in 2025.</p>
                    
                    <p>The goal of this project is to create an informative resource for Australian mango growers about pest and disease surveillance. This static website serves as the first phase (Objective 1) of a larger project that will eventually include an interactive surveillance calculator.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Project Background</h3>
                    <p>Australian agriculture contributes 10.8% of the country's goods and services exports. Unfortunately, millions of dollars are lost each year due to pests or plant diseases. Robust plant surveillance data can help Australian growers and governments improve the prevention and management of potentially catastrophic pests and plant diseases.</p>
                    
                    <p>Mango production is an important industry in Australia, particularly in northern regions. Effective pest and disease surveillance is critical for maintaining productivity, fruit quality, and market access.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
                    <p><strong>Objective 1 (Current Phase):</strong> Build an informative but static website using Django that provides information about known pests and plant diseases affecting mangoes which require growers' surveillance.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Objective 2 (Future Phase):</strong> Develop the output of Objective 1 into an interactive web application using Django that can be used by growers to calculate the surveillance effort required to be undertaken on their property.</p>
